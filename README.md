Tech Stack:

    Frontend: React with Vite for high-performance rendering and responsiveness.
    Backend: Express API for managing core functionality, handling user requests, and providing secure endpoints.
    Database: MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring scalability as the platform grows.
    TypeScript: Used across the project to ensure type safety, improve code readability, and reduce runtime errors.

Key Technical Highlights:

    Fast Frontend Performance: Vite was used to optimize bundling and serve a fast-loading, responsive frontend with improved developer experience.
    Scalable Data Storage: MongoDB allows for flexible schema design and horizontal scaling, making it suitable for handling large amounts of user and event data.
    Type Safety and Code Quality: TypeScript was implemented throughout the project, providing strict typing and enhanced code quality, which improved maintainability and reduced bugs.

Challenges and Solutions:

    Complex Data Relationships: Implemented MongoDB's document schema to handle complex relationships between events, tickets, and users effectively.
